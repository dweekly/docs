## Understand tracking

- ### Analytical behavior
    - Whenever a user `clicks` on a deep link and `opens` the app
    - This triggers an `install`, an `open` (`re-open`), or `reinstall`
        - `installs` represent Branch recognizing the app_id and device_id for the first time
        - `installs` represent new app users and the success rate of your Branch deep links
        - `installs` do **not** represent App Store downloads
        - `non-Branch installs` are installs outside of Branch deep link clicks
        - `opens` are non-installs
        - If a user uninstalls and reinstalls the app, this will be a `reinstall` because Branch recognizes the device
        - If a user has the app and clicks a Branch deep link, this will be an `open` because the user is not new

- ### Dashboard behavior
    - The [Branch Dashboard](https://dashboard.branch.io/) is a great tool for measuring growth and engagement of your app
    - Branch tracks `click`, `installs`, and `opens` (`re-opens`) for both Branch related events and non-Branch related events
    - The values of the dropdowns are limited to the data within the `date range`
    - The `date range` filters for any any events (e.g. `clicks`, `installs`, `purchases`) in the selected date range. For example, this means the dashboard will show all attributed `purchases` that occurred during the selected date range, regardless of the date of click that lead to those purchases.
    - `Untracked` means this metric is non-Branch related (e.g. installs that don't come from Branch deep links)
    - `Unique` are the same unique user/browser based off fingerprint id and the time frame
    - `Unspecified` means that this metric does not have the selected filter (e.g. the Campaign field for the deep link is blank)

## Common Analytics Objectives

- ### User value attribution
    - Measure app growth through automatic `event tracking` and `user identity` tracking
    - Use [Configure you app](#dialog-code?ios=track-events&android=track-events&adobe=track-events&cordova=track-events&mparticleAndroid=track-events&mparticleIos=track-events&titanium=track-events&reactNative=track-events&unity=track-events&xamarin=track-events) to send events and user information (`email`, `ID`, `UUID`, etc) from your app to the [Branch dashboard](https://dashboard.branch.io/)
    - The `identity` is retroactively associated with any previously recorded events
    - Define all the custom events (`signups`, `purchases`, `shares`, etc.) you want to track
    - Branch automatically creates certain events whenever a user accesses your site or your app:

        | Key | Value
        | --- | ---
        | `install` | Triggered the first time a user launches your app
        | `open` | Triggered whenever the app becomes active (includes reinstalls)
        | `referred session` | Triggered in addition to install, open or web session start if a user comes from a Branch link
        | `web session start` | Triggered when the user views a webpage using the Branch Web SDK.

- ### Growth attribution
    + You can measure your app growth in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.branch.io) through automatic event tracking and user identity tracking.
    + You can also define as many custom events (signups, purchases, shares, etc.) as you wish - see the [User Value Attribution](/dashboard/analytics/#user-value-attribution) guide for more on tracking custom events. You can see these events as they occur on the Live View > Events page.

        - You must [identify your users](#dialog-code?ios=track-users&android=track-users&adobe=track-users&cordova=track-users&mparticleAndroid=track-users&mparticleIos=track-users&titanium=track-users&reactNative=track-users&unity=track-users&xamarin=track-users) in order for the `User ID` column to be populated. The `Branch ID` refers to the internal Branch ID associated with that user. The `Developer ID` is the value you assign when you set the identity
        - You must [setting identities](#dialog-code?ios=track-users&android=track-users&adobe=track-users&cordova=track-users&mparticleAndroid=track-users&mparticleIos=track-users&titanium=track-users&reactNative=track-users&unity=track-users&xamarin=track-users) within your app
